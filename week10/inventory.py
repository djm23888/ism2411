# Reflection 1:
# I was surprised by how easy it is to change a list by adding, removing, or sorting items.
# I also didn't expect negative indices to let me get items from the end of a list.
#
# Reflection 2:
# At a restaurant, a Python list could help me keep track of daily sales or items we need to restock.
# Instead of entering and checking every number in Excel, I could use a loop to find totals and important sales days.

# Exercise 1: Build the list
inventory = ["pen", "notebook", "stapler", "tape", "marker"]

print(inventory)

# Exercise 2: Index practice
print("\nExercise 2:")
print(inventory[0])
print(inventory[-1])
print(inventory[len(inventory) // 2])

# Exercise 3: Slicing
print("\nExercise 3:")
print(inventory[:3])
print(inventory[-2:])
print(inventory[::2])

# Exercise 4: Modify
print("\nExercise 4:")
inventory.append("envelope")
print(inventory)
inventory.remove("tape")
print(inventory)
inventory.sort()
print(inventory)

# Exercise 5: Tuple comparison

coords = (40.7128, -74.0060)
try:
    coords[0] = 99

    print("Tuples cannot be changed, so they are useful for keeping coordinates fixed.")
